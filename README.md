# CPP-cache-simulator
In this project I built a simple simulation of a multi-level memory: a CPU with one register, three levels of cache, and a main memory. I ran the simulation on a small program of load instructions, moving values from main memory into the register, and determine the total number of cycles needed to execute the program.
